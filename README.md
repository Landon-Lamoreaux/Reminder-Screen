# Reminder Screen

This is a project to use a ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7 as a reminder screen that can be updated with messages remotely.

Currently the project just connects to the wifi and displays text on the screen saying it is connected. In the near future it will create a webserver where a user can select or write messages for it to display.

To use:
1. Open the project with PlatformIO
2. Plug into the USB port, not the UART port.
3. Right before uploading click and hold the boot button then press the reset button then release the boot button.
4. Now you can upload.
5. Once the upload is complete press the reset button to start running the code on the board.
